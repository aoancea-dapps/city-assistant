## WHITE PAPER Version 0.1 by Alex Oancea

City assistant is community platform giving power to people to vote on solutions to important issues. It is centered around four important point of views: 

1. Global - world-wide solution voting collaboration
2. Continental - per continent solution voting collaboration
3. Country - per contry solution voting collaboration
4. City - per city solution voting collaboration

We believe in a world where power is given to the people such that decisions are driven by the need of community and not by the greed of the few.
