### Chapter 1 - Problem description
#

Humans are a pack species. We stay in groups forming communities. These have evolved along the years from villages to full blown cities. Some cities like Paris, London, New York have so many people that it is extremely to impossible to get an oppinion from everyone when a decision needs to be made that affects the local community.

Even if a voting system would be in place, it would be extremely difficult for everyone to check their phones every 5 minutes and if it's something to vote to do so. It requires to be informed on the matter to make the best decision!

Currently there are several solutions in place trying to pull in everyone's thought towards building participatory decisions by local communities by none address the issue of increasing the participation level and rewarding the involved individuals.

### Chapter 2 - Solution description
#

#### Vision

City assistant is community platform giving power to people to vote on solutions to important issues. It is centered around four important point of views:

1. Global - world-wide solution voting collaboration
2. Continental - per continent solution voting collaboration
3. Country - per contry solution voting collaboration
4. City - per city solution voting collaboration(we start with this, hence the name)

We believe in a world where power is given to the people such that decisions are driven by the need of the community and not by the greed of the few.

#### Users

Everyone will be able to access the `City assistant` platform.

Each user will have the following information associated also called the `user profile`:
1. City - used to change the view of information
2. Name - the name can be changed but not their account address
3. Photo

Between normal users and local authorities there should be no difference but in their name.

We might be able to view a history of all changes done to the user profile. Tracking such information will lower the possibility of abuse.

Content will be driven by:
1. People driven
2. Local authority driven

#### People driven content

People from the local community are able to create posts with projects that solve certain issues or enhance already present structures.

We will refer to such post as `community project proposal`

#### Local authority driven content

#### Voting & delegation

#### Use cases

#### Token model

### Chapter 3 - Business model
#

### Chapter 4 - Technical solution description
#

### Chapter 5 - Stages of development
#

The development life cycle of `City Assistant` requires several stages of developemnt: 
1. Q2 2018 - Concept + R&D
2. Q3 2018 - UI Platform development
3. Q4 2018 - Pre-Alpha Version Release on Test Net
4. Q1 2019 - Alpha & Beta Release on Test Net
5. Q2 2019 - Alpha Release on Main Net
6. 2020 Onwards - Enhancements and voting on Country, Continental, Global issues enters development

_Note: The above information is subject to change as we advance in development and new things are discovered. A diagram for a more visual perspective will be provided soon._
