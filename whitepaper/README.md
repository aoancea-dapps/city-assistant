City assistant is community platform giving power to people to vote on solutions to important issues. It is centered around four important point of views: 

1. Global - world-wide solution voting collaboration
2. Continental - per continent solution voting collaboration
3. Country - per contry solution voting collaboration
4. City - per city solution voting collaboration

We believe in a world where power is given to the people such that decisions are driven by the need of community and not by the greed of the few.
