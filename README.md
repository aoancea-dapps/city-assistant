## Project direction and views
Main idea of the project shifted a bit: We are completely focusing on the Project Platform for now:
- people can propose and vote on specific projects for a city
- this information is available online and local authorities can pick it up and use it to build these projects
- each project contains a comments section to help exchange ideas and brainstorm missing pieces

1. A user can set himself on a specific Region and City from that Region -> he will view only information from that Region/City
2. Regions and Cities are Voted by the community - proposer is the only one being rewarded if it's voted(still working on max number of votes required)
3. Region and City preferences are saved in cookie/local storage/session storage for now(need to decide on which) - no point in saving these on the blockchain every time a user wants to move from a Region/City to another
4. We might restrict adding a new post for a user in a specific Region/City such that people won't end up having several posts in multiple Regions/Cities as you can't live in two places at once or if it's the case, you pick one or pay the price for switching them
5. We might introduce voting on comments, which will generate points
6. We need a way of exchanging CAT for ETH or make everything on the platform consume CAT as this is local currency(this might not be possible now)
